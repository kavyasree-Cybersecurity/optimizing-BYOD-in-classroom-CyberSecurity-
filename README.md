# Securing and Increasing Productivity of BYOD in Classrooms at Schools

## Overview
The **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** model in educational institutions enhances learning by allowing students to use personal devices such as laptops, tablets, or smartphones. However, it presents challenges related to network security, classroom focus, and productivity. This project addresses these issues by developing a **secure web portal** that empowers teachers to filter and control website access during classroom sessions.

**Problem Statement**
Many schools allows students to bring their own devices (computer, handhelds or smartphones) to school to help with their learning. Most of the time now teachers encourage students to access online content as content becoming richer with videos and interactivity. Lots of school might even conduct exams on these devices. Now this increases necessity for teachers to have better control on learning and they would like ability to control/filter website access of student during class as desired per the curriculum. What we want: A web portal each school can have to give ability to teachers to block/filter websites based on student's names and or classes. You should be able collect student device and username information via wireless access points and apply some kind of filtering using firewalls.
